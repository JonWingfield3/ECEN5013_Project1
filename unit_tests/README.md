This is the unit_tests directory for project 1.
This directory contains two unit test files and a makefile.
To easily build the executable tests run the following commands:

$ make atoi_test   # will build atoi_test.

$ make mem_test    # will build mem_test.

To ensure that the makefile works properly maintain the structure that is present.
At the very least, memory.c and data.c should be in the parent directory of the unit_tests directory.

The tests are currently fairly simple and most data.c functions are not being tested yet.
